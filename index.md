## About Me
Hello and welcome! I am Wencheng Han, a recent Ph.D. graduate (June 2025) from the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jianbing Shen.
My academic journey began with a bachelor’s degree from Shandong University (2012–2016), followed by a master’s degree from Beijing Institute of Technology (2019–2022). I completed my Ph.D. in just three years, focusing on computer vision and autonomous driving.
Before my graduate studies, I worked at Sina Weibo as a Recommendation System Development Engineer (2016–2019), gaining practical experience in large-scale machine learning systems.

My research interests lie in perception for autonomous driving, including Monocular Depth Estimation, Monocular 3D Object Detection, and Visual Tracking. I’m also exploring AI applications in healthcare, with a focus on multi-modal learning and medical imaging.


## Research Interests

- **Autonomous Driving:** Monocular Depth Estimation, Monocular 3D Object Detection, Visual Tracking, etc.
- **AI for Medical:** Medical Vision, Medical Large Language Model
