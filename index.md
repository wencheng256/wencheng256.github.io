## About Me
Hello and welcome! I am Wencheng Han, a postdoctoral fellow at the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (SKL-IOTSC), University of Macau. I recently completed my Ph.D. in June 2025 under the supervision of Prof. Jianbing Shen.
My academic journey began with a bachelor’s degree from Shandong University (2012–2016), followed by a master’s degree at Beijing Institute of Technology (2019–2022). I completed my Ph.D. in just three years, focusing on computer vision and autonomous driving.
Before my graduate studies, I worked at Sina Weibo as a Recommendation System Development Engineer (2016–2019), where I gained hands-on experience in large-scale machine learning systems.

My research interests include perception for autonomous driving—such as Monocular Depth Estimation, Monocular 3D Object Detection, and Visual Tracking—as well as AI for medical applications, particularly in multi-modal learning and medical imaging.


## Research Interests

- **Autonomous Driving:** Monocular Depth Estimation, Monocular 3D Object Detection, Visual Tracking, etc.
- **AI for Medical:** Medical Vision, Medical Large Language Model
